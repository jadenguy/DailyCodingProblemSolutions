// You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.
// For example, given the array [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], you should return 3, since the top floors of the buildings with heights 8, 6, and 1 all have an unobstructed view to the west.
