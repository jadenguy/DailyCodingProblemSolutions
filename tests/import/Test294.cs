// A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house, with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.
// Given a dictionary of places of the form {location: elevation}, and a dictionary mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances, find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location 0.
// For example, suppose you are given the following input:
// elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
// paths = {
//     (0, 1): 10,
//     (0, 2): 8,
//     (0, 3): 15,
//     (1, 3): 12,
//     (2, 4): 10,
//     (3, 4): 5,
//     (3, 0): 17,
//     (4, 0): 10
