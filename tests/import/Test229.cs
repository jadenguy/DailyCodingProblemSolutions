// Snakes and Ladders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders>  is a game played on a 10 x 10 board, the goal of which is get from square 1 to square 100. On each turn players will roll a six-sided die and move forward a number of spaces equal to the result. If they land on a square that represents a snake or ladder, they will be transported ahead or behind, respectively, to a new square.
// Find the smallest number of turns it takes to play snakes and ladders.
// For convenience, here are the squares representing snakes and ladders, and their outcomes:
// snakes = {16: 6, 48: 26, 49: 11, 56: 53, 62: 19, 64: 60, 87: 24, 93: 73, 95: 75, 98: 78}
