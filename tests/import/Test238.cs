// *	The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
// *	The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed 21.
// *	The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise pass.
// *	Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding 21 is the winner.
// For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between 2 and 10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces count as 1.
