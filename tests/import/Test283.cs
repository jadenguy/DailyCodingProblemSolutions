// A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of 60. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.
// These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.
