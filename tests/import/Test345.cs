// You are given a set of synonyms, such as (big, large) and (eat, consume). Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.
// For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:
// *	"He wants to eat food."
// *	"He wants to consume food."
// Note that the synonyms (a, b) and (a, c) do not necessarily imply (b, c): consider the case of (coach, bus) and (coach, teacher).
